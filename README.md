# üèÜ Shopify Awards üèÜ

This project was published by me as part of a project challenge for the [Shopify](https://www.shopify.ca/) Winter 2021 internship.

## The Challenge:

<em>The Shoppies: Movie awards for entrepreneurs

Shopify has branched out into movie award shows and we need your help. Please build us an app to help manage our movie nominations for the upcoming Shoppies.</em>

Check out my [deployed challenge!](https://sad-pike-030d48.netlify.app/)


## Features:
- Users can search for their favourite movies and nominate them for the awards
- They can nominate up to 5 movies, but can also remove them from the list and change them out if wanted
- Once the user has reached 5 movie nominations they will see an alert

## Additional:
- Simple user friendly loading spinner animation


## Stack:
- React.js
- CSS
- HTML

## Using:
- Styling Library: Evergreen UI
- API: OMDb

## With More Time:
- I would have liked to add user functionality and a back end with a database
- Another api request to gather more information about each movie (rating, description, director etc) to display in the larger movie card with the nominate button
- More animation features: when adding and removing the movies from the nomination list
- I would have liked to have a responsive design, however the style library I chose wasn't conducive to this


This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
